# Testing Requirements

## Test-Driven Development
- Write tests BEFORE implementation
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies properly

## Test Coverage
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Test all public APIs
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Verify cleanup and teardown

## Test Organization
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup/cleanup
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use proper assertions (not just truthy checks)
- Document complex test scenarios

## Testing Tools
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Supertest for API testing
- Mock external services and APIs
- Use proper test data factories
