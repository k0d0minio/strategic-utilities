# Write Tests Command

## Overview

Generate comprehensive tests following TDD principles with specific patterns.

## Steps

1. **Test Planning**
   - [ ] Identify the function/component to test
   - [ ] List all possible inputs and edge cases
   - [ ] Define expected outputs for each case
   - [ ] Plan test structure (unit, integration, e2e)

2. **Test Implementation**
   - [ ] Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
   - [ ] Use descriptive test names
   - [ ] Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - [ ] Mock external dependencies properly

3. **Test Patterns**
   - [ ] Happy path testing
   - [ ] Edge case testing
   - [ ] Error condition testing
   - [ ] Integration testing where needed

4. **Test Execution**
   - [ ] Run tests to ensure they fail initially
   - [ ] Implement code to make tests pass
   - [ ] Refactor while keeping tests green
   - [ ] Verify test coverage meets requirements

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests written before implementation
- [ ] All edge cases covered
- [ ] External dependencies mocked
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Coverage threshold met
- [ ] Tests run successfully
