## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

The template includes seven powerful AI commands that automate common development workflows:

### `/review-code`
Comprehensive code review focusing on:
- Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, auth issues)
- Code quality (TypeScript types, error handling, complexity)
- Performance optimizations (memory leaks, re-renders, queries)
- Test coverage and edge cases

### `/project`
Large ticket project management and splitting:
- Analyzes large triage tickets (>3 days work, multiple features)
- Creates comprehensive Linear projects with detailed descriptions
- Defines realistic milestones with target dates and dependencies
- Splits original ticket into smaller, classified sub-tickets
- Preserves original content verbatim in each sub-ticket
- Links all sub-tickets to created project
- Keeps sub-tickets in Triage column for further analysis

### `/write-tests`
Test-driven development with:
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Proper mocking of external dependencies
- Minimum 80% coverage requirement

### `/ticket`
Advanced Linear ticket implementation planning:
- Fetches tickets from "Ready for Dev" column
- Creates comprehensive implementation plans
- Generates detailed technical specifications
- Includes risk assessment and testing strategy
- Mandatory approval process before implementation
- Automatic git branch creation with proper naming

### `/triage`
Linear ticket triage and analysis:
- Analyzes tickets in the Triage column
- Conducts research and technical analysis
- Adds clarifying comments or splits large tickets
- Creates actionable sub-tasks with clear acceptance criteria
- Moves properly scoped tickets to "Ready for Dev"

### `/fix-bug`
Systematic bug fixing using:
- Complete codebase scanning
- Root cause analysis (not just symptoms)
- Minimal fix implementation
- Regression testing
- Verification process

### `/setup-project`
Interactive project initialization:
- Project type selection (React/Next.js, Node.js, full-stack)
- Package manager configuration
- External service integration setup
- Development preferences
- Security configuration

## üéØ AI Behavior Rules

The template includes intelligent rules that adapt AI behavior based on file types:

### Core Behavioral Rules (`000-core-behavior.mdc`)
- Always understand codebase before suggesting changes
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Apply modifications to single file at once
- Never rename methods unless absolutely necessary
- Always raise errors explicitly, never silently ignore

### TypeScript & React Rules (`100-typescript-react.mdc`)
- Strict TypeScript mode enforcement
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper cleanup in useEffect
- Component size limits (200 lines max)
- Custom hook extraction for complex logic

### Node.js & Express Rules (`150-node-express.mdc`)
- Guard clauses and early returns
- Custom error types with clear messages
- RESTful API conventions
- Input validation and security
- Performance optimization patterns

### Testing Rules (`200-testing.mdc`)
- Test-driven development enforcement
- Comprehensive test coverage (80% minimum)
- Proper mocking strategies
- Edge case testing requirements

### Next.js Rules (`250-nextjs.mdc`)
- App Router patterns (Next.js 13+)
- Server Components by default
- Performance optimization
- SEO and metadata implementation

### MCP Integration Rules (`300-mcp-integration.mdc`)
- Security best practices for API keys
- Minimal permission requirements
- Tool usage guidelines (max 40 tools)
- Confirmation for destructive operations

## üîß MCP Server Integration

The template includes pre-configured MCP servers for external service integration:

### Available Servers
- **Vercel**: Deployment management and preview environments
- **Linear**: Project management and issue tracking
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for testing

### Configuration
The MCP servers are configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`:
- **Vercel**: Uses hosted MCP service at `https://mcp.vercel.com`
- **Linear**: Uses remote MCP service via `mcp-remote`
- **Playwright**: Uses official Playwright MCP package

### Security Features
- Environment variable configuration
- API key protection
- Minimal permission scopes
- Read-only mode options

## üö¶ Quality Gates

Built-in quality enforcement includes:

- **File Size Limits**: Components under 200 lines, functions under 50 lines
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript mode, no `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Explicit error raising, no silent failures
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **Security**: Input validation, secret protection, SQL injection prevention

## üé® Supported Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS
- React Testing Library

### Backend
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express.js

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine
2. **Copy the `.cursor` directory** to your project root
3. **Run `/setup-project`** command in Cursor to configure your project
4. **Configure API keys** in `.cursor/config/environment.json` for external integrations
5. **Start developing** with AI-powered commands

## üìã Usage Examples

### Setting up a new React project:
```
/setup-project
# Follow the interactive prompts to configure:
# - Project type: React/Next.js
# - Package manager: npm/yarn/pnpm
# - TypeScript: Yes
# - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
# - Styling: Tailwind CSS
```

### Processing large triage tickets:
```
/project
# Analyzes next large ticket in Triage column
# Creates comprehensive Linear project with milestones
# Splits into smaller, classified sub-tickets
# Links all sub-tickets to created project

/project LINEAR-123
# Processes specific large ticket by ID
# Same project creation and splitting process
```

### Processing Linear tickets:
```
/ticket
# Fetches next ticket from "Ready for Dev" column
# Creates comprehensive implementation plan
# Generates git branch with proper naming
# Requires approval before implementation

/ticket LINEAR-123
# Processes specific ticket by ID
# Same comprehensive planning process
```

### Triaging tickets:
```
/triage
# Analyzes next ticket in Triage column
# Adds clarifying comments or splits into sub-tasks
# Moves properly scoped tickets to "Ready for Dev"
```

### Planning a new feature:
```
/ticket
# Use the ticket command for feature planning
# Creates structured implementation plan in tmp/
# Includes current state, final state, file changes
# Requires approval before implementation
```

### Writing comprehensive tests:
```
/write-tests
# Generates tests following TDD principles
# Covers happy paths, edge cases, error conditions
# Ensures proper mocking and coverage
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in `.cursor/config/environment.json`
- This file should be added to `.gitignore`
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
- Use minimal required permissions for external services
- Regular API key rotation recommended
- MCP servers use secure remote connections
